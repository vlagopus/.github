## Security

The source code contained within this repository is provided as a reference implementation for the companion article, and is not intended for production use or for use with sensitive information. If looking to adapt any of the concepts discussed within this repository or the companion article, it is recommended to conduct the appropriate reviews and threat modeling to identify potential vulnerabilities within the reference source code or your own implementation.

The repositories of [aeydr](https://github.com/the-aeydr) are written to take security seriously, however this is not a substitute for your own threat modeling.

## Reporting Security Issues
